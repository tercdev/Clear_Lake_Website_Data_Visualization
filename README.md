Clear Lake, the largest lake in California and one of the oldest lakes in North America, is subject to eutrophication as a consequence of the high concentrations of nutrients. These nutrients stimulate high concentrations of algae and cyanobacteria and consequently present severe challenges to Lake County, the lake users, and stakeholders. UC Davis is engaged in a multi-year research study to understand the dominant processes in the Clear Lake watershed and in the lake itself that are negatively impacting the restoration of the lake water quality and the ecosystem health. We are currently collecting a wide variety of data to form the basis of a long-term monitoring strategy to measure the status and trends in the future in Clear Lake. 


## Clean Data

This folder contains clean data in which the client has given to the team. 
- CTD
    - [(old)ClearLake_ProfileData_2019_2021.csv](https://github.com/tercdev/Clear_Lake_Website_Data_Visualization/blob/main/Clean%20Data/CTD/(old)ClearLake_ProfileData_2019_2021.csv) contains other CTD monitoring stations that are not included on the Clear Data website, such as LA03_SB25 and UA01_SB25
    - [ClearLake_ProfileData_2019_2021.csv](https://github.com/tercdev/Clear_Lake_Website_Data_Visualization/blob/main/Clean%20Data/CTD/ClearLake_ProfileData_2019_2021.csv) contains merged CTD monitoring stations
- Meteorological
- Stream
    - the flow and rain data files were gathered from this github repo: https://github.com/micahswann/CL_wix
- Tchain
    - lake temperature and dissolved oxygen time series at multiple depths from seven locations
    - cleaned, merged, and exported all data between spring 2019 and Fall 2021
    - includes both temperature and dissolved oxygen for each site
