## Background 

Clear Lake, the largest lake in California and one of the oldest lakes in North America, is subject to eutrophication as a consequence of the high concentrations of nutrients. These nutrients stimulate high concentrations of algae and cyanobacteria and consequently present severe challenges to Lake County, the lake users, and stakeholders. UC Davis is engaged in a multi-year research study to understand the dominant processes in the Clear Lake watershed and in the lake itself that are negatively impacting the restoration of the lake water quality and the ecosystem health. We are currently collecting a wide variety of data to form the basis of a long-term monitoring strategy to measure the status and trends in the future in Clear Lake. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## `npm run deploy`

Deploys new changes made on the main branch onto the hosted website using GitHub Pages
The hosted site is [https://tercdev.github.io/Clear_Lake_Website_Data_Visualization/](https://tercdev.github.io/Clear_Lake_Website_Data_Visualization/)

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
