Researchers from University of California, Davis and the Tahoe Environmental Research Center deployed seven "permanent" water quality stations 
(moorings) to measure water temperature and dissolved oxygen conentration. 
These stations have no surface expression and consist of a weight at the bottom, a sub-surface buoy, and a taut line with set of sensors attached.

Each station consists of up to 12 RBRsolo3 temperature loggers (accuracy ±0.002 deg C and resolution ±0.00005 deg C), 
1-2 RBRvirtuoso3 dissolved oxygen (DO) sensors (accuracy maximum of ±8µM or ±5% and resolution <1µM or saturation 0.4%), 
and ocassionally a PME miniDOT DO sensor. 

The six mooring sites are: LA_03, NR_02, OA_04, UA_01, UA_06, UA_08. Individual GPS locations are provided for each site.

Morrings were first deployed in March 2019 and mantained every ~3-4 months. 

Archived data are every 1 hour, but higher temporal resolution of these data sets can be obtained upon request. 

The available variables are:
(Please, let me know the name of the variables that show up in your react up, and I will provide full name and untis. thanks!)
-> each site includes data on different height levels (eg. not all sites will have heights listed below)
-> eg. LA03TEMPERATURE has all of the height levels listed
