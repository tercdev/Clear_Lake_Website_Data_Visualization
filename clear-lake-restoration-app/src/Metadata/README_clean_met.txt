THIS IS PROVISIONAL DATA ONLY AND HAS NOT BE QAQC'd.

Researchers from University of California, Davis and the Tahoe Environmental Research Center installed seven Davis Instruments Vantage Pro2 meteorological stations around the perimeter of Clear Lake from March 20-21 2019. 
Initial stations were located in Konocti Bay and Jago Bay in the Lower Arm, Clearlake Oaks in the Oaks Arm, Big Valley Rancheria, North Lakeport and Nice in the Upper Arm and at Buckingham Point near the Narrows. 
Data is recorded every 15 minutes and transmitted via a Davis Instruments Vantage Connect to Weatherlink.com. Real time data from all monitoring stations is available to the public via this site as well.

Deployment Notes
- Nice station was vandalized in 5/4/20 and stopped transmitting data. Station was repaired and reinstalled ~1 mile down the road on 6/23/20
- Jago Bay station was taken offline on 6/23/20. This station was not measuring characteristic winds of the Lower Arm. Station was moved to Beakbane Island at the Highland Water Co treatment intake on 6/23/20.
- North Lakeport station was offline From Aug - Oct 2020 due to equipment malfunction

Column Heading Descriptions
# Date - Sample date in local time (PST and accounts for DST) [DD/MM/YY]
# Time - Sample time in local time (PST and accounts for DST) [HH:MM (AM/PM)]
# Temp Out - Outside Air Temperature [Degrees C] ISSâ€™s temperature measures outside air temperature. Vantage Pro 2 samples every 8 seconds and continuously updates an average temperature for an interval
# Hi Temp - High Outside Air Temperature [Degrees C] Highest air temperature measured during an archive interval
# Temp Out - Outside Air Temperature [Degrees C] ISSâ€™s temperature measures outside air temperature. Vantage Pro 2 samples every 8 seconds and continuously updates an average temperature for an interval
# Hi Temp - High Outside Air Temperature [Degrees C] Highest air temperature measured during an archive interval
# Low Temp - Low Outside Air Temperature [Degrees C] Lowest air temperature measured during an archive interval
# Out Hum - Outside Relative Humidity [% full saturation]	
# Dew Point - Dew Point	[Degrees C] The temperature at which the air must be cooled for 100 % saturation to occur. See Equation 1
# Wind Speed - Wind Speed [mph]	
# Wind Dir - Direction for Wind	[30Â° Cardinal direction] If wind speed is greater than 0 mph, Weatherlink sample wind direction, places a â€œmarkerâ€ in one of 16 â€œbinsâ€ that correspond to the 16 compass points.
# Wind Run - Wind Run [miles of wind] The measurement of the â€œamountâ€ of wind passing the station during a given period of time, expressed as â€œmiles of windâ€. Weatherlink calculates wind run by multiplying the average wind speed for each arrive record by the archive interval.
# Hi Speed - High Wind Speed [mph] Highest wind speed observed during archive interval
# Hi Dir - Direction of High Wind Speed [30Â° Cardinal direction]	Direction of highest wind speed observed during archive interval
# Wind Chill - Wind Chill [Degrees C]	
# Heat Index - Heat Index [ index number] Standard  lookup table presented by Steadman (1979) is used to find index value for corresponding Relative Humidity and Air Temperature
# THW Index - Temperature Humidity Wind Index [index number]	
# THSW Index - Temperature Humidity Sun Wind Index[index number] Like Heat Index, the THSW Index uses humidity and temperature to calculate an apparent temperature. In addition, THSW incorporates the heating effects of solar radiation and the cooling effects of wind (like wind chill) on our perception of temperature. 
# Bar - Barometric Pressure - [in Hg]
# Rain - Rainfall Total	[in] Summed number of tips of 0.01 tipping ran guage
# Rain Rate - Rainfall rate [in/hr] Rain rate is calculated based on the time between successive tips of the rain collector. The rain rate value is the highest rate since the last transmitted rain rate data packet. If this time exceeds roughly 15 minutes, than the rain rate value is reset to zero. When there is rainfall within the archive period, the highest measured value is report.
# Solar Rad - Solar Radiation [W/m2] A measure of the amount of solar radiation hitting the solar radiation sensor at any given time. The value logged by WeatherLink is the average solar radiation measured over the archive interval.
# Solar Energy - Solar Energy [Langley]	The amount of accumulate solar radiation over a period of time (Eqn 4)
# Hi Solar Rad - Highest Solar Radiation [W/m2] The peak solar radiation measured during the archive interval
# UV Index - Ultra-Violet Radiation Index [UV Index] UV index uses a sacle of 0 to 16 to rate the current intensity of UV. UV value logged by weatherLink are average during the archive interval
# UV Dose Ultra - Violet Radiation Dose [Dose	
# Hi UV - Hi UV Index [UV index] The peak UV measured during the archive interval
# Heat D-d - Heating Degree Days [HDD]	
# Cool D-D - Cooling Degree Days[CDD]	
# ln Temp - Inside Air Temperature [Degrees C] Air Temperature inside display console measured inside air temp
# ln Hum - Indoor Relative Humidity [%]	
# In Dew - Indoor Dew 	point Temperature [Degrees C]	
# In heat - Indoor Heating [Degrees C]	
# In EMC - Indoor equilibrium moisture content [%]	
# In Air Density - Indoor Air Density [ kg/m3]	
# ET - Hourly potential Evapotranspiration [mm]
# Wind Samp - Wind Samples [count]	Number of accurate wind samples collected during sampling interval
# Wind Tx - RF Channel for Wind Data [channel]			
# ISS Receipt - ISS reception [%] The percentage of wind data package that has been successfully received by the Vantage Pro 2 instrument.
# Arc Int Archive Intervals [m]	Data collection frequency
