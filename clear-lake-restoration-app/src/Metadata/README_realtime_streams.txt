THIS IS PROVISIONAL DATA ONLY AND HAS NOT BE QAQC'd.

Researchers from University of California, Davis and the Tahoe Environmental Research Center installed three DT2-12 Digital Turbidity Sensors manufactured by Forest Technology Systems along Kelsey Creek (39.0084 N, 122.83922 W) , Scotts Creek (39.09544 N, 122.96104
W) and Middle Creek (39.18255, 122.91184 W) in Lake County, California. These sensors are co-located with existing Department of Water Resources (DWR) stream gauging stations. 


Instrument Operations

The turbidity station has been programmed to record and transmit data every 10 minutes by executing the following measurement cycle: 
1. Powering up the sensor head.
2. Calibrating the analog to digital converter circuitry.
3. Read the water temperature.
4. Do a wipe if the water temperature is not too low 
5. Acquiring 100 samples at 20 samples per second. 
6. Perform statistical calculations as required. 

The turbidity sensor has a range 0-1,500 NTU, a resolution 0.01 NTU, an accuracy of 2% of full-scale reading in the range 0-500 NTU, and 4% of full-scale reading in the range of 500- 1500 NTU.
Temperature accuracy is +/- 0.1 deg. C. Data are uploaded via modem after every reading to the Environmental Dynamics Lab (EDL) of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of California, Davis.
